Lab 1 - Variables and Logic

Task
Convert.java Write a small command line application (Convert.java) that allows a user to convert between different forms of measurement. The program should:

Collect a numeric value from the user and store it in an appropriate variable
Collect the current unit of measurement
Determine the appropriate conversion (in either direction, ie the user can enter km or mi)
Display the new result
Some units and their conversions to consider (pick at least 6 of the following, or add others):

1km = 0.62mi
1mi = 1.61km
1cm = 0.39in
1in = 2.54cm
1kg = 2.2lb
1lb = 0.45kg
1g = 0.04oz
1oz = 28.35g
C to F (𝐶×9/5)+32
C to K 𝐶+273.15
F to C (𝐹−32)×5/9
F to K (𝐹−32)×5/9+273.15
1L = 4.17cups
1cup = 0.24L

Time Commitment
This lab should take approximately 2 hours

Sample

Input is in bold. You do not need to do all of the input in one line. Multiple lines is acceptable (both are provided as an example).

>java Lab1Sol
Enter a value to convert: 10 km
10.0 km is equal to 6.2mi
>java Lab1Sol
Enter a value to convert: 54 cm
54.0 cm is equal to 21.06in
>java Lab1Sol
Enter a value to convert: 4
Enter the current unit of measure: kg
4.0kg is equal to 8.8lbs
>java Lab1Sol
Enter a value to convert: 10
Enter the current unit of measure: C
10.0c is equal to 50.0F
