Lab 1 - Variables and Logic

Task
Convert.java Write a small command line application (Convert.java) that allows a user to convert between different forms of measurement. The program should:<br />

Collect a numeric value from the user and store it in an appropriate variable
Collect the current unit of measurement
Determine the appropriate conversion (in either direction, ie the user can enter km or mi)
Display the new result
Some units and their conversions to consider (pick at least 6 of the following, or add others):<br />
<br />
1km = 0.62mi<br />
1mi = 1.61km<br />
1cm = 0.39in<br />
1in = 2.54cm<br />
1kg = 2.2lb<br />
1lb = 0.45kg<br />
1g = 0.04oz<br />
1oz = 28.35g<br />
C to F (𝐶×9/5)+32<br />
C to K 𝐶+273.15<br />
F to C (𝐹−32)×5/9<br />
F to K (𝐹−32)×5/9+273.15<br />
1L = 4.17cups<br />
1cup = 0.24L<br />
<br />
Time Commitment<br />
This lab should take approximately 2 hours<br />
